Next title won't be first post and I really hope it won't take more than a month like this one.

This post is about Udacity's __Mobile Web Specialist__ and my new role at the __WCA Ethics comitee__.
<!--more-->

During the last weeks of August I almost was able to graduate on Udacity's __Mobile Web Specialist__, I was through two of the three projects but couldn't finish on time but I certainly was able to watch all the stuff and learn most of the content. Udacity gives me the chance to enroll again by half the price which I will probably do soon. In the meantime I plan to apply some of the stuff I have learnt there on my work at UNED and in some other projects like JukiMods. I will probably also write about responsive design, accessibility and progressive design in this blog, which are the main contents of this Nanodegree.

Changing topic, I've recently become part of WCA's external staff by joining the __WCA Ethics Comitee__ our goal is to create a Code of Ethics for all WCA staff to abide by and to investigate actions of WCA Staff that might be unethical. I'm really glad I can help and give back some of what WCA brings me.
