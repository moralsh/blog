> See you in a few days!

... Or just a couple of years :)

I'm just writing this bit because I'm starting to update this site, I have changed some things already

<!--more-->

Mainly I've just added a *tourism* category in which I'll try to speak a bit about my travels, I've also redirected moralsh.org to the website and this blog is now under blog.moralsh.org.

I'll be adding some things to the porfolio section and will investigate if I can have multi language on this blog.

See you in a few days! (I hope)
