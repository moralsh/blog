_First post_ must be one of the most common titles for first (and in many cases last) post of a blog.

It's self explanatory and I guess an easy test to check out if everything behaves as expected.

I guess most of the stuff here will be work related (programming, developement), but I'm sure some cubing stuff will also end up here once in a while, We might also have a mix of both things as the JukiMods web project.

I'll try also to comment some news of both fields.

Let's see where we end up!
