I've been involved in the speedcubing world for quite some time (seven years). I've always tried to help out in whatever way I can. These are the main areas I've been involved with:

- **Organizing competitions**. Prior to this infamous year, I've organized competitions every year (Starting in 2014) and tried to help out in other competitions. I take pride in the several National championships I've been involved with and of course in Euro 2018.
- **World Cube Association**. Currently main translator to the web and I try to help with some code when time permits. I was involved with WEC as per my second post for like a year and a half.
- **Spanish Association**. I was a member of the Board for around 4 years and I am currently helping a bit with coding.

Other than that, I staffed in Worlds 2017 which was a great experience.
